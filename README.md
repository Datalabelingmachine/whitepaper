## Abstract

This paper presents Data Labeling Machine (DLM), a decentralized platform designed to fundamentally transform the semantic data structuring process through the integration of blockchain technology, advanced cryptographic mechanisms, and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies. DLM addresses pervasive challenges inherent in data annotation, including but not limited to data privacy, security, scalability, and quality assurance, through a meticulously designed architecture.

This architecture comprises a decentralized data economy, a token-driven incentive model, and an advanced privacy-preserving framework, all underpinned by rigorous cryptographic protocols. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of DLM's architecture, detailing its smart contract framework and privacy-enhancing technologies such as Garbled Circuits, Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE), and Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). Furthermore, the system's performance and security are critically evaluated through a series of pilot implementations, with comparative analyses drawn against conventional data annotation methodologies. The findings demonstrate that DLM significantly elevates the standards for secure and efficient data labeling, establishing it as an indispensable tool in the progression of AI-driven systems and applications.
